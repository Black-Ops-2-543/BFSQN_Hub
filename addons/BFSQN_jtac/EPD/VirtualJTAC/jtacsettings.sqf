	payloadCategory - One of "BULLETS", "SHELLS", "STRAFINGRUN", "BOMBS", "ROCKETS", "GUIDEDMISSILE", "MINES", "SMOKE", or "NIGHT" . Determines which Jtac menu the payload will show up in.
	
	displayName - Name of the payload that will be presented to the operator.
	
	acquireRate - Seconds required to aquire a target.

	capacityUsed - The amount of the remaining capacity the attack will use. When the capacity is reached a long reload is triggered.
	
	projectileFiringMethod - One of "SHOOT_PROJECTILES", "DROP_BOMBS", "FIRE_ROCKETS", "EVEN_SPREAD_PROJECTILES", "STRAFING_RUN_ROCKET", "STRAFING_RUN_PROJECTILE", "LAY_MINE_FIELD". Determines which method will be used to send the payload to the target.
	
		SHOOT_PROJECTILES - Traditional technique of sending a projectile at a target. Projectile will be spawned about 2.2km away and flung towards the target.
			parameters - [_projectileClassName, _verticalOffset, _numberToSend, _spreadRadial, _spreadNormal, _minTimeBetween, _maxRandomTime]
				_projectileClassName - Classname of the projectile to use.
				_numberToSend - How many projectiles to shoot.
				_verticalOffset - How many meters to aim up over the top of the target so it can hit the target.
				_spreadRadial - Radius of the horizontal inaccuracy. Projectiles can land anywhere in a circle of this radius around the target.
				_spreadNormal - Height of vertical inaccuracy. Think aiming too high or low. Turns the inaccuracy circle into an oval.
				_minTimeBetween - Minimum time between shots.
				_maxRandomTime  - A random value of up to this value is added to the _minTimeBetween variable to provide some variable time between shots.
				_height - Optional starting height for the projectile.
				_distance - Optional starting distance for the projectile.
				_speed - Optional starting speed for the projectile.

		DROP_BOMBS - Spawns the payload about 4.2km away. Sets the correct orientation and gives it a bit of velocity.

				_projectileClassName - Classname of the projectile to use.
				_numberToSend - How many bombs to drop.
				_initialSpeed - How fast the bomb is going.
				_speedVariance - The speed of the bomb will be adjusted by up to this much. This will cause the bomb to undershoot or overshoot.

				_minTimeBetween - Minimum time between shots.
				_maxRandomTime  - A random value of up to this value is added to the _minTimeBetween variable to provide some variable time between shots.

		EVEN_SPREAD_PROJECTILES - Spawns 12 of the items randomly above the target and flings them down. Creates an evenly space inner triangle and an evenly space outer nonagon.
			parameters - [[_projectileClassName, _projectileClassName,_projectileClassName,...], _spreadRadial, _downwardSpeed, _spawnHeight]
				_projectileClassName - Classname of the projectile to use. 1 or more of these can be passed in.
				_spreadRadial - Radius of the horizontal inaccuracy. Projectiles can land anywhere in a circle of this radius around the target.
				_downwardSpeed - Initial downward velocity before gravity kicks in.
